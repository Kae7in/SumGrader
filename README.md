# SumGrader
A Python script made specifically for grading student feedback files in Dr. Alison Norman's CS439 class.  
  
Sum Grader traverses all student directories, scavenging for their
feedback.txt files, and sums the design and documentation grades in each of them.
The result is an output pairing each student's eid with their overall grade:
'eid grade  
eid grade  
eid grade  
eid grade  
...'  
  
This helps avoid having to do hand calculations.
